reverse a linked list

keep track of a min value in a stack in constant time

how can I reason about this problem based on the data structures I know

data strcuture is an arragement of data, how you interact with this data and how it's displayed in memory

array - uma do lado da outra na memoria
ordered data structs
hierarchical
complex relationships

search, sort, get particular values... do that all the time, but in different scenarios

DOM is a tree, traversing the DOM all the time.

how traversing something like a tree works

DATA STRUCTURE            USED FOR
arrays, strings            ordered data, words
hash tables               optimization   --> typically lookup
linked lists              data insert/ delete   --> build other data stuctures, like an array (under the hood)
stacks/queues             creative aux DS    --> keep track of things as an aux ds
trees/ heaps              hierarchical data 
graphs                    complex relationships
