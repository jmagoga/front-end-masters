fast look up ??? hash table!!!

hash table is not ordered 

good for fast lookups and keys that are flexible


they organize data for quick look ups on value for given keys

translate keys into a memory address (bcs we need to go directly there)

like, I just point here... and there's the value. I don't need to loop through all of them

this is constant time look up!

now it's just gonna be the index of an array. under the hood it could be an address in memory

they're used in security... passwords...

once it's half full, you double it

para ficar em um alcance e 25 (range), apenas mod o número por 25!!! 
ex, 100 % 25 --> 0
99 % 25 --> 24
98 % 25 --> 23

for the same string, you wanna have the same value everytime

para add algo a uma hash table,  botamos O VALOR do que queremos adicionar. para fazer o LOOKUP, mesma coisa!!!
  
IN REAL LIFE

{}
Map --> still have a key value pair, but any data type can be saved just like in a set. not only a string...
Set --> just saves the property name (only the key, which can be string, object, whatever) (in a reguar object, everything gets stringified)



what's the appropriate ds, can i just save functions? do I need a key value or just a key?
