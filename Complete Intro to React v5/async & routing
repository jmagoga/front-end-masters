async function is guaranteed to return a promise

returns a promise that will resolve when a function completes

the super power is the 'await' keyword

await --> wait here in this function until this completes then give me back the data

could use .then ... but you can just 'wait for this to finish and give me back the data'

npm install -D cross-env         //para funcionar em macos, linux, windows
