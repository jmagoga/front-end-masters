SET
no duplicates
good for usernames for example
no sense of order...
no *guarantee* of order
set has no values, just the key
tem no ES6. Set()

MAP (also known as dictionaries)
has a set of keys (elas nao se repetem)
unlike objects:
  maps don't have methods, functions, prototype, inheritance,
no sense of order
not intended to be used as objects
tem no ES6 agora Map()

STACK
last in, first out. cant get anything else out of it
temos 'push' e 'pop' vem daqui -- push to the top, pop it out of the top
arrays have a stack interface, but they are not strict to this order
method peek, to see what's at the top
      -we are always programming on a stack!!! pensar em funções chamadas dentro de outras funções... 
      sempre se poe no stack, tira do stack, *last in, first out*
programming is a stack
